# Baseline Installations

Similar to DRRS, we provide two installation methods: using the provided Docker image (recommended) or building from source.
1. Docker-based Installation: Pull the same Docker image used for DRRS: `docker push floudk/drrs-experiment-suite:latest`.
2. Building from Source: Follow the same steps as for DRRS, with the exception that you should replace the original Flink modules with those found in the `MECES-on-Flink`/`Megaphone-on-Flink` directories.
